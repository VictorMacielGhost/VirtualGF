# VirtualGF AI: The Handmade Companion

Welcome to the **VirtualGF AI** project! This is a lighthearted study experiment designed to explore programming concepts while having some fun. Inspired by Monika from *Doki Doki Literature Club*, this project skips modern AI models and instead uses handcrafted logic and database interactions to simulate a virtual companion. Think of it as a mix of learning, memes, and a sprinkle of creativity.

---

## Features

- **Handcrafted Logic:** No fancy AI models here—just simple TypeScript-based rules and logic.
- **Database-Driven Personality:** Personality traits and responses are powered by a structured database.
- **Customizable and Playful:** Adjust the VirtualGF's responses and quirks to suit your mood.
- **Inspired by Monika:** A dash of meta-awareness and engaging dialogue to keep things interesting.

---

## Why This Project?

1. **Learning Opportunity:** Practice and improve TypeScript skills, database management, and basic logic programming.
2. **Entertainment:** Build something quirky and fun that doesn't take itself too seriously.

---

## How It Works

1. **Logic Engine:** Core interaction rules written in TypeScript.
2. **Database Integration:** SQLite (or similar) stores personality traits, dialogue, and events.
3. **Interaction Interface:** Initially console-based, with potential for a web UI in the future.

---

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript:** Ensuring type safety and clean code.
- **Node.js:** Runtime environment for the logic engine.
- **SQLite:** Lightweight database to store VirtualGF's data.
- **(Future Idea)** A simple front-end framework for a UI.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16+ recommended)
- A package manager like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Steps to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VirtualGF-AI.git
   cd VirtualGF-AI
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the database:
   - Use the provided SQL script to initialize the database schema.
   - Update database connection settings in the `.env` file.

4. Run the project:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
